# Bioinformatics_MasterThesis
This repository contains the scripts developed by Alicia L. Bruzos in 2016 for her master thesis project: "Full catalogue of LINE-1 active loci in cancer genomes". The main objective of the scripts that I have developed was to find all samples that could support the same L1 source element and make a cluster with them. This led a small bash script and two of R scripts; therefore, the last step was to develop a bash script in order to automatize the previous steps.
